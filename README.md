(R)Apid (A)pplication (Dev)elopment

A Virtual Programming Language, it does not compile natively, instead it is converted to other programming languages

A hello world can be written in a few ways:
string x = "hello world"

write x
                                 <b> OR </b>
                                 
write "Hello world"

                                 
In IronRADev you can use raw C# code as well:
raw System.Console.Writeline("Hello World");
